# The problem
Return the remaining elements of an array after chopping off n elements from the head. Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: `slasher([1, 2, 3], 2);` must return [3]

## Analysis
Since we need only the remaining part of an array we can just remove what we don't.

## Understanding slicing
Slice allows to get only what you want from an array.

## Understanding the splice
If you want the **tail** of a snake remove the head first. The splice() method changes the content of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements. This can be handy. Get an array, remove the first part and return the remaining.

## Code Solution:

```javascript
function slasher(arr, howMany) {
  // remove the head
  arr.splice(0,howMany);
  //return the remaining or the tail  \__/(**)-<
  return arr;
}
slasher([1, 2, 3], 2);
```

## Code Solution 2:

```javascript
function slasher(arr, howMany) {
  
  //Return string after the amount chopped off.
  return arr.slice(howMany);

}
```
